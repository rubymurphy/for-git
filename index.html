<blockquote cite="https://www.upwork.com/resources/how-to-become-a-freelancer">Freelancing offers an incredible opportunity to control the way that you work. As a freelancer, you have the freedom to work from anywhere, at any time. Appealing perks like these are leading to the growth of the freelancing industry. In fact, more than one-third of the U.S. workforce is currently freelancing in some capacity, according to Upworkâ€™s recent freelancing research study.</blockquote>
